# The-Price-Is-Right
An Autonomous Agentic AI System for Real-Time Deal Discovery- a modular, multi-agent AI framework that autonomously discovers, evaluates, and pushes online deals to usersâ€”powered by LLMs, traditional ML, vector databases, and real-time orchestration. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed technical breakdown of each agent in this project, along with the specific tools, models, and technologies used by each. This will serve as a foundation for showing how every component contributes to the autonomous agentic AI system.

# 1. ðŸ§­ Planning Agent â€“ The Orchestrator

Role:
Coordinates all other agents. It initiates the system, triggers scanning, processes deals, and decides whether to notify the user.

Workflow Responsibilities:

â€¢	Calls the ScannerAgent to fetch new deals

â€¢	Uses EnsembleAgent to estimate prices

â€¢	Selects the best opportunity (based on discount)

â€¢	If discount > $50, uses MessagingAgent to alert user

Tech Stack:

â€¢	Python OOP for agent design

â€¢	Modular design to enable swappable pricing or messaging agents

# 2. ðŸ”Ž Scanner Agent â€“ The Intelligent Scraper

Role:
Finds new deals from RSS feeds and selects the best 5 using LLMs with structured output.

How it works:

â€¢	Scrapes RSS feeds using ScrapedDeal.fetch()

â€¢	Constructs a structured JSON prompt using clear product criteria

â€¢	Sends the prompt to OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini

â€¢	Uses response_format=DealSelection to strictly enforce valid JSON

Tools & Tech Stack:

â€¢	OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini)

â€¢	Structured Output parsing for JSON validation

â€¢	Natural Language Processing for summarizing and rephrasing product info

â€¢	Logging + filtering logic to avoid duplicate entries

# 3. ðŸ“Š Ensemble Agent â€“ The Value Synthesizer

Role:
Combines predictions from three different pricing models and returns a weighted, aggregated price.

Workflow:
â€¢	Calls:

o	SpecialistAgent (LLM)

o	FrontierAgent (LLM + RAG)

o	RandomForestAgent (ML model)

â€¢	Collects prices from all three

â€¢	Creates a feature vector including Min/Max

â€¢	Runs a Linear Regression model (trained separately)

â€¢	Returns weighted predicted price

Tech Stack:

â€¢	Scikit-learn for ensemble regression (ensemble_model.pkl)

â€¢	Pandas for data formatting

â€¢	Joblib for model loading

â€¢	Modular agent integration

# 4. ðŸ”¬ Specialist Agent â€“ The Fine-Tuned LLM Model

Role:
Predicts product price using a fine-tuned Meta-LLaMA 3.1-8B model hosted on Modal.

Details:

â€¢	Hosted remotely using Modal's GPU infrastructure

â€¢	Model is quantized and fine-tuned with PEFT for efficiency

â€¢	Uses a custom pricing prompt, e.g., "How much does this cost?"

â€¢	Returns structured price output

Tech Stack:

â€¢	Modal for serverless deployment (modal.App)

â€¢	Transformers + PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)

â€¢	Quantization (bitsandbytes) for fast inference

â€¢	Meta-LLaMA 3.1-8B base model, fine-tuned for price estimation

â€¢	Hugging Face Hub for model download & storage
________________________________________
# 5. ðŸ§  Frontier Agent â€“ The RAG-Powered Estimator

Role:
Estimates price using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with similar products retrieved from a vector database.

How it works:

â€¢	Encodes the product description with Sentence Transformers

â€¢	Queries ChromaDB to retrieve 5 similar products

â€¢	Builds a detailed prompt with price context

â€¢	Sends to GPT-4o-mini or DeepSeek LLM

â€¢	Parses price from LLM response

Tech Stack:

â€¢	ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval

â€¢	Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings

â€¢	OpenAI GPT-4o-mini or DeepSeek for LLM predictions

â€¢	Prompt engineering for multi-example context injection

â€¢	Regex parsing to extract numeric price from LLM output
________________________________________
# 6. ðŸŒ² Random Forest Agent â€“ The Classic ML Baseline

Role:
Predicts price using a trained Random Forest model on semantic embeddings of product descriptions.

Workflow:

â€¢	Encodes description using SentenceTransformers

â€¢	Loads pre-trained model (random_forest_model.pkl)

â€¢	Predicts price and returns the result

Tech Stack:

â€¢	Scikit-learn Random Forest Regressor

â€¢	SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

â€¢	Joblib for model serialization

# 7. ðŸ“¢ Messaging Agent â€“ The Notifier

Role:
Sends push notifications (via Pushover) or SMS alerts (via Twilio â€“ optional).

Workflow:

â€¢	Constructs a concise message with price, estimate, discount, and product URL

â€¢	Sends either:

o	Push Notification using Pushover API

o	SMS using Twilio API (currently disabled by default)

Tech Stack:

â€¢	Pushover API (for real-time notifications)

â€¢	Twilio (optional, SMS-ready)

â€¢	Environment Variables (.env) for API keys and credentials

â€¢	HTTP client (http.client) and URL encoding (urllib)

# ðŸ§© Bonus: UI Layer (Gradio)

Role:
Offers a user-facing interface for live interaction and deal display.

Features:

â€¢	Live table of deals: Description, Price, Estimate, Discount, URL

â€¢	Periodic refresh with gr.Timer

â€¢	Deal selection triggers alerts

â€¢	Fully local and browser-based launch

Tech Stack:

â€¢	Gradio Blocks

â€¢	Python event-driven handlers

â€¢	Live Refresh with gr.Timer
